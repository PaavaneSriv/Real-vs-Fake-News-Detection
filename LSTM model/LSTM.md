# Real vs Fake News Detection - Using LSTM model

## 🎯 **Project Objective**

To build and deploy an **end-to-end machine learning application** that classifies whether a given news article is **real or fake**, using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model and a **Streamlit-based web interface**.


## 💡 Key Goals:

1. **Detect fake news** using deep learning techniques by training on labeled text data.
2. **Build an interactive UI** using Streamlit so users can input news and get instant feedback.
3. **Preprocess textual data** effectively (tokenization, padding, etc.) to feed into the LSTM model.
4. **Save and load models and tokenizers** for efficient reuse during inference.
5. **Deploy the model** streamlit Cloud.

## 🗂️ Data used:
1. Political fake news
2. Political real news 


## 📦 What It Demonstrates:

* Text classification using **LSTM (NLP + Deep Learning)**
* Integration of **TensorFlow/Keras** models with **Streamlit**
* Application of **text preprocessing techniques** (tokenization)
* Ability to **deploy machine learning projects**
* End-to-end understanding of **data → model → app → user**
